# AlexaASKNetTemplate

Project was started to create a C# VS project template for building the foundational pieces needed to create an Echo Alexa Skill. The template will spin-up a C# project with all the base needs for creating an Alexa Skill.  It is still a work in progress.  The project can then be published to Azure as the host for your given Alexa Skill.

To test:
Go to the folder AlexaASKNetTemplate/EchoTemplate/VSIX Template/ and run the VSIX wizard.  
It will install a new template (VS 2015) called EchoTemplate. (you may need to restart VS)
Create a (File=>New) project from the Echo Template

Enjoy and please contribute to the base project.
